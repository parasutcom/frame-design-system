## Overview

Typography serves as the foundation for tone, voice, and content. Given that the majority of FDS’ visual design comprises text, achieving the right balance in typography is a key factor in enhancing the overall usability of online products.

FDS’ typography aims to optimize legibility, organize information, and clearly communicate concepts to establish hierarchy and guide users through a product or experience. A successful hierarchy employs a concise set of size and weight combinations to create focal points and outline the content of a page in an easily scannable structure.

## Type Stack

We are using two different font stacks for FDS. Inter is used for all normal text content, while Jetbrains Mono is only used for numerical values.

## Type Styles & Scales

There are three main styles distributed throughout the interface that help convey the content; heading, body, labels (and semantics).
