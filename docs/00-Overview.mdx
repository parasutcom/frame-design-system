## Quick Start

The fastest way to get started with the Frame Design System is by adding the following script tag to your page: 

````html
<script type="module" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/frame-design-system@0.19.0/dist/bundle.min.js"></script>
````

By adding this script, you'll have access to all of the Frame Design System components! You can start using them immediately. For example, here is how to add a button to your project: 

````html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Frame Design System</title>
  <script type="module" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/frame-design-system@0.19.0/dist/bundle.min.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <fds-button variant="primary">Welcome Frame!</fds-button>
</body>
</html>
````

This is the quickest way to start using Frame Design System components.
