# Installation

Frame Design System offers multiple installation options to meet different project needsâ€”This guide provides detailed instructions on how to install and integrate our web components into your project.

The easiest and quickest way to start is using our CDN, which allows you to add components directly in your HTML with a single `<script>` tag. This method is perfect for rapid prototyping, static HTML pages, or projects without a build process.

Using the CDN, you can instantly start using Frame Design System components without local setup or build steps.

For more advanced use cases, such as projects with a build pipeline, we recommend installing via NPM.

## CDN Installation

Add the following in the `<head>` of your project:

````html
<script type="module" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/frame-design-system@0.16.0/dist/bundle.min.js"></script>
````

## NPM Installation

### System Requirements

- Node.js: v18.0.0+
- npm: v9.0.0+

### Prerequisites

Before installing the Frame Design System via NPM, you need to set up authentication for Font Awesome Pro we use for icons: 

1. Create a `.npmrc` file in the root of your project (if it doesn't already exist). This file will store your Font Awesome authentication token.
2. Contact the Frame Design System team to get your Font Awesome Pro token.

Once you have the token, add the following lines to your `.npmrc` file:

````
@fortawesome:registry=https://npm.fontawesome.com/
@awesome.me:registry=https://npm.fontawesome.com/
//npm.fontawesome.com/:_authToken=YOUR_FONTAWESOME_TOKEN
````

Replace `YOUR_FONTAWESOME_TOKEN` with the token provided by our team.

After setting up the `.npmrc` file, you can install the Frame Design System package by running:

````bash
npm install @parasutcom/frame-design-system --save
````

Once installed, import the Frame Design System into your project:

````javascript
import '@parasutcom/frame-design-system/dist/bundle.js';
````

Now that you have installed the Frame Design System, you're ready to start using it in your project.

## Troubleshooting

If you run into issues during installation, check for these common problems:

- **Font Awesome Authentication Error**: Ensure that your Font Awesome Pro token is correctly added to your `.npmrc` file.
- **NPM Installation Failure**: Review any error messages in the terminal after running `npm install` and ensure that you have a stable internet connection.
